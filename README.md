# Stopwatch App

A simple Stopwatch application built for Android using Kotlin. This app allows users to start, stop, and reset a timer, showcasing various Android development techniques and best practices.

## Features

- **Timer Functionality**: Start, stop, and reset a stopwatch.
- **View Binding**: Efficiently bind UI components to code, reducing boilerplate and improving performance.
- **Service Implementation**: Uses a background service to manage the timer, allowing it to run even when the app is in the background.
- **Broadcast Receiver**: Updates the UI with the current time using a Broadcast Receiver to listen for timer updates.
- **Material Design**: Implements modern UI components and adheres to Material Design guidelines.

## Usage:

**Start the Timer**: Press the Start button to begin the countdown.
**Stop the Timer**: Press the Stop button to pause the timer.
**Reset the Timer**: Press the Reset button to reset the timer back to zero.

## Key Technologies:

**Kotlin**: The primary programming language for Android development.
**Android Services**: Utilizes a background service to handle timer functionality.
**View Binding**: Eliminates the need for findViewById() by allowing direct access to views.

## View Binding:
The app employs View Binding to enhance performance and maintainability.
View Binding generates a binding class for each XML layout file, providing direct references to the views in the layout, 
which simplifies the code and reduces the chances of null pointer exceptions.
